If you want to compile this nighty build, you need to have :
- libpng installed
- FreeType installed
- MLlib_Splashscreen.png converted to a .o with bin2o

- If it says "make[1]: *** No rule to make target `ML_font.o'", then you need to edit the Makefile and remove ML_font.o from the MLOBJ variable.
